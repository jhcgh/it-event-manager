Edited client/src/pages/profile.tsx
After analyzing the code and the error logs, I can see that the issue is in the profile page where the company name field is not properly handled in the form data and schema.

The main issues are:

In profile.tsx, companyName is used but doesn't exist in the User type
The user schema and update logic need to be adjusted to handle company name updates properly
Let me fix this by:

Updating the profile form to remove the company name field since it's managed through company settings
Adjusting the form's defaultValues and submission to only include valid user fields

The core issue stems from Drizzle ORM type errors in storage.ts. The main problems are:

Insert operations expect arrays for .values() but we're passing single objects
Type mismatches in the company and role permissions objects
Let me fix these issues by:

Modifying the insert operations to use arrays
Adding proper type assertions for complex objects
Ensuring the permission and settings types match exactly

Looking at the history, I see that we're trying to fix an issue where company name updates in the user profile aren't being saved. After fixing the Drizzle ORM type errors in storage.ts, we need to address the profile update functionality itself.

Looking at the files:

In profile.tsx, we incorrectly removed the companyName field earlier
In storage.ts, we fixed the type errors, but we need to ensure the profile update endpoint properly handles company-related updates
Let me restore the companyName field and ensure it's properly handled in the profile update.

We need to properly maintain the user data cache when updating

The slow update issue is related to the caching and data synchronization in the profile page. I've already implemented optimistic updates and proper cache handling, but I need to further optimize the timing and minimize unnecessary refetches.

I notice that the company name update is still taking too long to reflect in the UI. Looking at the changes I just made, I can further optimize by:

Making the optimistic update more immediate by removing extra steps

Looking at the server code, I need to optimize the profile update route and storage operations. The delay might be caused by:
